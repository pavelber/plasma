 0.003  "fluMin". Spectral lines with absorption oscillator strength < "fluMin" are too weak vs continuum and/or instrumental noise, 	
                  therefore, to reduce computation time, we exclude these lines from the computations. 
 3.d9   "AulMin". Spectral lines with Einstein A coefficient < "AulMin" are excluded by same reason			 
 1.     "hvMin"  DON'T INCREASE!. Soft edge of hv interval because probability of photoinduced transition requires FULL hv interval 
40.d3   "hvMax"  DON'T DECREASE!  Hard edge of hv interval ..............                                    
 9      "domNu"  <30 is number of domains in hvV(iv) array 
  470. , 0.3     "hehv(i)" is hard edge if i-th hv domain. , "dvKv(i)" is dv/v in this domain. Each domain is (hehv(i-1), hehv(i)] 
  930. , 0.01	 e.g. 0.3  is dv/v in (  0 < hv <=  470 eV] domain

35     "NCL" in the code == NT in manual. 2 < NCL < 100 is the number of coaxial cylindrical tubes, see Fig.1 
                 == number of plane radial belts on seen-to-detector plane image of target, see Fig.2
36     "Ntet" >= 18 is number of sectors over polar angle 0 <= teta <= pi 
30     "Nr"         is number of spherical layers IN EACH of 3 zones (BS, Core, Capsulle)

1                "nGauLor" is serial number of frame to be convolved with Gaussian and Lorentzian  
                 instrumental functions. Convolved frames are printed in file "FrameGauLor.dat", print (191 
12700.,  17200.	 [eV] "minGaLor" and "maxGaLor" are edges of interval for which instrumental function is known.
                 In this interval we convolve one Frame with instrumental Gaussian and Lorentzian. 
				 IMPORTANT: this interval must be inside one highly-resolved domain.
6.e-4,  0.,  0.  three constants of quadratic fit to instrumental broadening: dv/v = Ains + Bins* (hv[keV]) + Cins* (hv[keV])^2
