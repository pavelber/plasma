0.003   "fluMin". Spectral lines with absorption oscillator strength < "fluMin" are excluded from computations	
3.d8    "AulMin". Spectral lines with Einstein A coefficient < "AulMin" are excluded from computations			 
                  because these lines are weak vs continuum and/or uncertainty (noise) in spectrograms. 
 3.     "hvMin" is soft edge of full hv interval. DON'T INCREASE "hvMin" because computation of photoinduced probabilities requires FULL hv interval 
40.d3   "hvMax" is hard edge of full hv interval. DON'T DECREASE "hvMax" because computation of photoinduced probabilities requires FULL hv interval                                    
1.5d-4  "hvRe"  is minimal (finest) dv/v in full hv-interval (this dv/v is reached at hv = hvFine); then dv/v increases linearly towards "hvMin" and "hvMax" where dv/v reaches 4*minimal. 
5682.      "hvFine" [eV] is hv at which spectral resolution is the best, here at Cr He-A
12000., 18000. "hvIns1", "hvIns2" are the edges of convolution of computed spectrograms with the instrumental function
