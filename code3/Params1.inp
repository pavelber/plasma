  23,  21,  25,  22  "FSS" is the first Spectroscopic Symbol (SpS) of Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn in the database, e.g. 23 for Be-like Fe
  26,  24,  28,  25  "HSS" is SpS of H-like Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn in the database; If new chemical element has HSS > 28, increase "HSSm" in "mo1code3.for" 
 161, 161, 161, 161  "Nnu" is the serial number of nuclei in "QSs....inp". 													  
 387, 387, 387, 387  "NST" is the number of energy levels (ELs) in database of each chemical element.

                 because these lines are weak vs continuum and/or uncertainty (noise) in spectrograms. 
 1.       "hvMin"   is soft edge of full hv interval. DON'T INCREASE "hvMin" because computation of photoinduced probabilities requires FULL hv interval 
30.d3     "hvMax"   is hard edge of full hv interval. DON'T DECREASE "hvMax" because computation of photoinduced probabilities requires FULL hv interval                                    
2.d-4     "hvReso"  is minimal (the finest) dv/v in [hvMin-hvMax] interval. This dv/v is reached at hv = hvFine; then dv/v increases linearly towards "hvMin" and "hvMax" where dv/v reaches 4*"hvReso"
6973.175      "hvFine" [eV] is hv at which spectral resolution is the best, here at Ly-A of Fe
